          The <strong>chicken</strong> <em>(Gallus domesticus)</em> is a
          domesticated <a href="#">junglefowl</a>species, with attributes of
          wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are
          originally from Southeastern Asia. <span>Rooster</span> or cock is a
          term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a
          cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female
          bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a
          <span>pullet.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens
          were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries
          BC).[2][3] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
          (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets. Chickens are one of
          the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total
          population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[4] up from more than 19 billion
          in 2011.[5] There are more chickens in the world than any other
          bird.[5] There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth,
          folklore and religion, and in language and literature.

        <h2>Terminology</h2>

        <h3>General biology and habitat</h3>
        <p>
          Chickens are omnivores.[28] In the wild, they often scratch at the
          soil to search for seeds, insects, and even animals as large as
          lizards, small snakes,[29] or sometimes young mice.[30] The average
          chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the breed.[31] The
          world's oldest known chicken lived 16 years according to Guinness
          World Records.[32]

        <h3>Behavior</h3>
        <p>
          Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a
          communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young.
          Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a
          'pecking order', with dominant individuals having priority for food
          access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock
          causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking
          order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an
          existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[34]
